# Themed Tempaltes

Fred works by assigning Templates to Fred themes. If a page in a MODX site uses a template which is assigned to a Fred Theme, it will show Fred controls when working from the front-end and logged into the MODX Manager.

A MODX Template can only be assigned to a single Fred Theme.
