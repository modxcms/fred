# Elements

Elements are the building blocks or design patterns that you use to create sites and themes. Elements usually include HTML markup and a corresponding group of controls (“[Settings](../options/index.md)”) accessed from the gear icon in the front-end. Elements can include Twig logic in the markup to do things like show or hide parts of a page depending on the conditions you set in the Settings.
