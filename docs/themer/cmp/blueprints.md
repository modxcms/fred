# Blueprints

Blueprints can only be [created from the front-end](../../blueprints.md). Theme developers can use Blueprints as sample pages which users in turn use to start building a site more quickly. Blueprints function as a “replace the placeholders” way to create content, comprised of one or more Elements with sample content and images in place. 

## Managing Blueprints

Blueprints can be managed from the Manager’s `Extras` top menu > `Fred` > `Blueprints` tab > `Blueprints` sidebar section. Right-click or click the gear icon to Quick Update the Blueprint in a modal, Update it the page itself, or Remove it to delete it from your Theme.
