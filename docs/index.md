# What is Fred?

Fred is a visual drag-and-drop **fr**ont-end **ed**itor for [MODX CMS](https://modx.com). It empowers ordinary people to create exceptional content without knowing how to code or learning complex interfaces. 

You can create content with Fred by merely dragging Elements from a sidebar and dropping them where you wish for them to appear. Select the copy you wish to change or click an image you want to update, edit directly in your browser, and click a green checkmark to save the changes. 

## What does Fred do for developers and site builders?

Fred helps theme builders break into the MODX ecosystem. It is easy to port existing themes to Fred and export them ready for the [MODX Extras](https://modx.com/extras/). 

Fred offers existing MODX developers an option to create more flexible and intuitive experiences for their site owners. Fred can power designs that would otherwise require dozens of TVs, a complex Manager UI, or tricky Manager customization. 

Fred brings content creators familiar visual controls like sliders, toggles and color pickers. Further, these controls can pass parameters to MODX Snippets and its API for a bulletproof and powerful content creation solution. 

In short, Fred makes constructing complex pages simple for even the most non-technical users.

## How is Fred different from other visual content builders?

Fred adheres to MODX’s core tenet of Creative Freedom. It doesn’t force you into someone else’s preferred front-end framework or way of building things. If you can imagine or prototype it, Fred can power it—without compromise. 

Developers and designers can realize pixel-perfect websites and confidently turn over content creation duties without fear of things breaking. 
 
So whether a site is made by customizing a free starter theme, or handcrafted 100% from scratch, Fred can help everyone build websites faster, more consistently and with better results.
