Fred Elements are the basic building blocks used by end-users to create content. They can be as simple as a single headline or paragraph, or more complex like a hero intro with configurable background images, text padding, opacity settings and more.

- Page Intros
- Feature Sections
- Quotes
- Code Blocks
