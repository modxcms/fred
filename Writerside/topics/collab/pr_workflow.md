# Using Gitify to Collaborate with Pull Requests

Some projects will require you to submit a Pull Request (PR) to their repository. You do this by forking the repo, making changes in a feature branch in your fork, then submitting the PR to the original project.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll fork the [Fred Starter Theme](https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter) which is intended to be a Bootstrap 4 quickstart for theme builders. Start by signing into Github.

## Fork and clone to a MODX instance

To start with PRs, you need to fork a repository and work on feature branches before you can submit PRs successfully.

### 1. Fork a repository

Fork the repository you wish to contribute to on Github: For example, visit the [Fred Theme Starter](https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter) and click the `fork` button in the upper right.

Click the down-arrow on the green `Clone or download` button on a source Github project and copy the HTTPS URL which looks like `https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git` for use later. You’ll also need your fork’s SSH URL, found in the same location, for example `git@github.com:your_username/your-fork-name.git`.

### 2. Clone your fork to your MODX instance

Because `git clone` only works in empty directories, we’ll use a temporary `tmp/` directory and move the files to the web root when done. Open an SSH connection to your working Cloud instance and execute:

```bash
cd ~/www
git clone git@github.com:your_username/your-fork-name.git tmp
```

This will download the theme repository into a `~/www/tmp/` directory in the Cloud. Next, move the contents of `tmp/` to the correct location under `www/`:

```bash
rsync -av ./tmp ./
```

Make sure the `.git/` directory and files are moved under webroot `www/` directory. Once you confirm the files and directories are in the right place, go ahead and remove the `tmp/` directory with `rm -rf ./tmp`.

### 3. Add the `upstream` remote

This is the original project. Use its HTTPS clone URL from step 1 of this tutorial to set the remote upstream:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git
```

## Working with your fork

Syncing is important, but how you sync depends on the state of your work: if you have made changes that have not been pushed, or if you are syncing ahead of starting work (no changes).

### No changes: Sync the `upstream` remote to your fork

For the purposes of working with PRs, you should _never_ commit directly to your master branch; for more information see the [Feature Branches and Pull Requests: Walkthrough](https://gist.github.com/vlandham/3b2b79c40bc7353ae95a)  and [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) guides.

Before pushing any work to a feature branch, you should sync your local repository with the upstream. For more information on syncing forks see the [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) guide:

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/master  # only merges if local is clean
git push origin master               # push to your fork
gitify package:install --all
gitify build
```

These commands are only needed when there is a differnce between the commit version in the upstream remote and your local fork. It will not hurt to run them every time though.

### Local changes: Sync the `upstream` remote to your fork

The following commands create your local feature branch, and commits them to the local git repo.

```bash
cd ~/www
git checkout -b my-feature   # checkout to a new branch named `my-feature`,
                             # or any other name you decide for your work
gitify extract               # extract all your local changes
git add --all                # or git add only specific changed files
git commit -m "My Changes"   # Use a more reasonable commit message
```

Next, we sync upstream master branch with your fork.

```bash
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
git push origin master
```

Now, we sync the feature branch with any changes from the master branch of the fork from the previous merge step.

```bash
git checkout my-feature      # checkout your `my-feature` branch again
git rebase master            # this pulls from your forked master```
```

This may result in conflicts that will be noted. If there are conflicts, they must be resolved before you can continue. A conflict happens when two people change the same line of code. For information on resolving conflicts, please see [Github’s guide to resolving conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/).

Finally, we build all the changes into your working MODX instance with Gitify.

```bash
gitify package:install --all
gitify build
```

Double check to make sure the Theme and the changes still work as expected. Then commit them to your Github fork, where it can then be submitted as a PR to the original upstream project:

```bash
git push origin my-feature   # push to your `my-feature` branch on Github to
                             # submit as a PR, per the next section below
git checkout master          # return to the master branch to start your next
gitify package:install --all # restore the `master` state to your local MODX
gitify build
```

Now submit the PR to the upstream project.

## Submit a PR to the upstream project

Open your fork on Github. There should be a notification about creating a PR from newly created branch. Click that and submit the PR to the appropriate branch, most likely `master` or as specified in the original repository README.
