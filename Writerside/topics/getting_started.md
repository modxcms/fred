# Getting Started

The easiest way to start with Fred is to install a Fred Theme.

1. Pick and install a Theme from the [MODX Extras repository](https://modx.com/extras/browse/?search=fred) into your MODX website.
2. Add a new page to your site. Choose one of the Templates from the Theme and save the Page.
3. Click the `Preview` button to visit this page from the front-end to start building with Fred.

If youâ€™re interested in creating Themes from scratch, please see the [Theme Creation Tutorial](themes.md).

## PHP Requirements

Fred requires PHP version 7.1.3 or later to run with support for the `php-bcmath` extension. PHP 5.5.9 or later should work, but is not officially supported, and we strongly recommend using non-EOL versions of PHP.

## Fred Editor Requirements

The Fred editing tool requires a modern browser:

- Chrome 41 or later
- Firefox 32 or later
- Safari 9.0 or later
- Edge 75 or later
