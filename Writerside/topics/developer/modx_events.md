No parameters are passed to this event, but it expects the output (assigned to `$modx->event->_output`) to be in this format:

$modx->event->_output = [
    'includes' => $includes,
    'beforeRender' => $beforeRender,
    'lexicons' => $lexicons,
    'modifyPermissions' => $modifyPermissions
];
```

';
```
