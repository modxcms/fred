# MODX Templates & Fred

Fred only loads on Pages which use MODX Templates that are assigned to a Fred Theme. These are identified in the Manager by visiting the `Extras` menu > `Fred` > `Themes` top tab > `Themed Templates` sidebar. Any pages that use a Template listed in this table will block access to the content area in the Manager and will load Fred on the front-end when logged in for editing.

## Dropzones

Most templates will have a *content* Dropzone. Fred also supports multiple Dropzones for things like sidebars, headers, footers, or any other purpose you may need. Dropzones are where you drag-and-drop Elements and Blueprints from the Fred sidebar.

## Creating Fred Templates
