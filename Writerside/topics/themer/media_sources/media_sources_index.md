# Media Sources

Media Sources can either be assigned globally via a setting in the Media Source itself, or in an Element’s settings by referencing the Media Source Name(s). On install two new settings are added to each Media Source. If you'll want to access Media Sources from Fred, you will need to manually add these settings. NOTE: Fred does not currently check a specific user’s Media Source permissions, and only reviews the following permissions.

## Media Source Settings

### fred

A Yes/No setting that defines if the Media Source is globally available to Elements rendered in Fred. _(defaults to no)_
### fredReadOnly

A Yes/No setting that locks a Media Source from being written to. _(defaults to no)_

## Element Settings

### mediaSource

ID of the Media Source to use for Finder. Multiple IDs can be passed separated by comma `,`.

### imageMediaSource

ID of the Media Source to use for Image fields. Multiple IDs can be passed separated by comma `,`. This option overrides `mediaSource`.
